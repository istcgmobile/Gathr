# Gathr

This repository holds the source code for an IST440 project Gathr - a small club and group management application for Android. 
The code is being used to demonstate concepts in action for IST Consulting Group - Mobile Team

As the project progresses more commits will be made often, but pulls from ISTCG members should only be done at meetings to ensure no inconsistencies in code.
